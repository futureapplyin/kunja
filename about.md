        <p>
          FutureApply was founded in 2025 by a team of education enthusiasts who experienced firsthand the challenges of finding and applying to colleges. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive platform that simplifies this process, they created FutureApply to serve as a bridge between students and educational institutions.
